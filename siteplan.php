                <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
                <p>The site that I would like to create is a family blog for my wife and I. I don’t really like any of the blog options available. They don’t allow me to have complete control unless I purchase a super ultra VIP membership. The site will have updates on our family, especially concerning my wife’s pregnancy. Other than a main blog my wife and I will have our own blog pages. Also included will be various other pages that will express who we are as a family. On the back end side I would like to make it easy for my wife to log in and write post and update things.
